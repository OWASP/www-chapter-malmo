## Welcome to OWASP Malmo
OWASP Malmo is a community for anyone interested in cybersecurity. There's a lot of software being produced in the region. Therefore, we believe that the primary focus should be on methods for improving software security throughout the lifecycle. We know that there are many specialists within development, software testing, cybersecurity, cloud, DevOps etc in our region. We hope that we can gather as many of you as possible, to share knowledge and experience related to security.
